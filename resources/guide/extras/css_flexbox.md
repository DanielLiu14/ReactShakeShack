# CSS Flexbox

Flexbox is a web layout feature of the modern CSS3. With raw CSS, positioning elements on the screen can be pretty difficult. You would have to play a lot with `display`, `float`, `position`, etc. properties to place elements where you want to. This becomes even harder when you need to take responsive design (shriking and enlarging your window size for mobile devices) into account as well!

Flexbox provides a way to easily position and resize your elements so you don't have to mix and match the above mentioned CSS properties.

## Challenge

In your sass files, remove ALL mentions of `floats`, and `position`-related properties. Instead, use Flexbox to organize your elements instead. When you're done, you should be able to have the same visual result, but elements should be positioned through flexbox!
