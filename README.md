# React with ShakeShack
A very basic guide to working with ReactJs and Stylus.
 - ReactJs is a popular web framework created by Facebook (https://reactjs.org/)
 - Stylus is a CSS pre-processor (https://stylus-lang.com/)

## Objective
Today, you will be creating an order management system at your favorite fast food chain Shake Shack Burgers!
In this exercise, you will learn the following concepts:
 - HTML DOM & CSS Basics
 - CSS Selectors
 - Using `<button>` and `onClick`
 - Using `<input>` and `onChange`
 - Using React `<Link>`
 - React component lifecycles
 - React `states`
 - React parent-children relationships
 - Creating lists (`<ul>` & `<li>`)
 - React `props`
 - Callback functions
 - Inserting images
 - Asynchronous function calls
 - Cookies & LocalStorage

## Getting Started
You will first need to install [nodeJS and npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

Traverse to the root directory (same directory as `index.html`).
```
npm install
```
If there are no errors, you should see a 'Built in: xx ms.'
You should see a `Server running at http://localhost:1234`
So in a browser (like Chrome), go to http://localhost:1234.

In your index.html, look for the following line:
```
<script src="./<THIS>/main.js"></script>
```
Make sure `<THIS>` is `components_starter`.
If you would like to see what the final app should look like, replace `<THIS>` with `components_answer`.
