# ReactForNoobs
A very basic guide to working with ReactJs and Stylus.
 - ReactJs is a popular web framework created by Facebook (https://reactjs.org/)
 - Stylus is a CSS pre-processor (https://stylus-lang.com/)

## Objective
Today, you will be creating an order management system at your favorite fast food chain Shake Shack Burgers!
In this exercise, you will learn the following concepts:
 - HTML & CSS Basics
 - CSS Selectors
 - Using `<button>` and `onClick`
 - Using `<input>` and `onChange`
 - Using React `<Link>`
 - React component lifecycles
 - React `states`
 - React parent-children relationships
 - Creating lists (`<ul>` & `<li>`)
 - React `props`
 - Callback functions
 - Asynchronous function calls

## Getting Started
Traverse to the root directory (same directory as `index.html`).
```
npm install
```
If there are no errors, you should see a 'Built in: xx ms.'
You should see a `Server running at http://localhost:1234`
So in a browser (like Chrome), go to http://localhost:1234.

### HTML & CSS Basics
 - What is a DOM?
 - div vs. span
 - block vs. inline vs. inline-block
 - box-model: width, height, margin, padding, border

### CSS Selectors
 - Using ids vs. classes
 - For the most part, you should be using classes. Give more descriptive names using kebab-case
 - How to select an element
 - How to select a class
 - How to select an element INSIDE a class
 - How to select a class INSIDE another class
 - How to use `stylus`

### Buttons and OnClick
 - How to use `<button>`
 - How to use it with `onClick`

### Inputs and onChange
 - How to use `<input>` as a text input field
 - How to use it with `onChange`
 - How to use `<input>` as a dropdown menu

### React Links
 - How to use `<Link>` instead of `<a>`

### React Component Lifecycles
 - What is a React Component?
 - render() function, returns a single HTML DOM
 - constructor()
 - componentDidMount() <- don't worry too much yet
 - componentDidUpdate() <- don't worry too much yet

### React States
 - what is it for?
 - how to initialize in constructor
 - how to use in render

### React Parent-child relationships
 - How to define another Component
 - How to inject it into a "parent" component?

### Creating Lists with React
 - What are `<ul>` and `<li>`?
 - How to use a for loop to create several `<li>` elements and add to render()

### React Props
 - What is it for?
 - how to use in render
 - how to change it? (Can only be changed from parent component)

### Callback functions
 - What does it mean?
 - Example

### Asynchronous calls
 - What is synchronous vs. asynchronous?
 - .then()
 - .error()
 - Special mention of Futures and Promises
